52865,US,"La Casita is made entirely from Dijon clone 114. It's a total ???wow??? wine, from the very first sip. Rich black cherry, chocolate and caramel flavors wrap tightly together.

78138,US,"A mind-bending array of aromas come to play in this bottling by Winemaker Billy Wathen, with savory tones of crushed pepper, teriyaki, fresh but underripe berry fruit, piquant forest underbrush, wet chaparral and raw lamb gaminess. It's surprisingly light and lithe on the lovely palate, with black peppercorn, thyme, lavender and complex beef-stew notes.",Williamson-Dor??

114873,New Zealand,"Most barrel-fermented Marlborough Sauvignons will set you back close to twice as much, making this a bargain.
