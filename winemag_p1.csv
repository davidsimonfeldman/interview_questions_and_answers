89695,Argentina,"Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.",Trumpeter,86,12,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Syrah,Rutini
23710,Argentina,"Foxy cherry and cough drop aromas are not convincing. Feels astringent and tastes tart, with sharp but candied cherry, faux oak and milk chocolate flavors. Blends sour notes with sweet oak, all to little avail.",Family Vineyards Organic Legacy Old Vines Single Vineyard,82,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Caligiore
139215,Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better.

31628,Argentina,"This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.",Reserva,84,12,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Viognier,Finca El Origen
118377,Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Reserva,85,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
119041,Argentina,"The â€œoakâ€ù in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.",Vika Oak,83,12,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Bodegas La Guarda
132683,Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Reserva,87,18,Mendoza Province,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
44070,Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",,86,10,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
129117,Argentina,"Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors. Has just enough acidity to keep it pumping, but as a whole it comes across a little too heavy and jammy compared to previous years.",A Lisa,85,25,Other,RÃ_o Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega NoemÃ_a de Patagonia
47010,Australia,"Ripe indeed, with confectioner's sugar, vanilla ice cream and honey aromas that lead to a light-to-medium-bodied palate with some disjointed oak notes and a slightly oily texture. Short but pleasant finish of figs and candied lemons. Drink up.",,84,11,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Madison Ridge
11285,Austria,"Beautifully pure apple fruit plays on nose and palate. Citrus juice frames the fruit and heightens the freshness even more. If you like a slender, supercrisp style of Riesling, the purity of this will have you hooked.",,93,20,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Schloss Gobelsburg

106022,Chile,"Slightly nutty and salinic on the nose, but mostly it's just neutral. Seems like an early maturing wine, meaning it's soft in its delivery of melon and apple flavors. Dry and a touch pithy on the finish.",Hacienda Araucano,85,12,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,FranÃ§ois Lurton
119883,Chile,"Stalky aromas suggest corn and hayfield more than crisp fruit, and while the palate is lively and acidic, it's also kind of sour and lemony. Finishes with green apple and citrus. Jumpy and scouring.",Pionero,83,9,CuricÃ_ Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,MorandÃ©

The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond.",Yverdon Vineyard,93,70,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terra Valentine
43682,US,"Made in the modern style of soft, sweet opulence, this is insanely rich, with notes of cherry marmalade, red currant, milk chocolate and sweet cedar flavors that continue onto the long, smooth finish. It's a blend of the traditional red Bordeaux varieties, and while it was aged in 100% new French oak, it's not too oaky. Drink over the next six years for its youthful beauty.",White Label,93,67,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Les Belles Collines
124341,US,"This is a heavy, dense and not very rewarding Pinot Noir at this time. It's soft and full-bodied and very ripe in cherries, blackberries and cola flavors. Could age to mellow sweetness, but it's a gamble.",Brosseau Vineyard,86,44,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,P2
143226,US,"Offers lush, intricate flavors of blackberries, cassis, roasted coffeebean, sweet milk chocolate and toasty oak in a soft, gentle wine that has complexity and interest. Not an ager, but a real beauty.",Winemaker's Reserve,91,35,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,ChÃ¢teau Souverain
117908,US,"The estate bottling is 100% SÃ©millon and tastes a bit riper and more peachy than the Columbia Valley bottling, though perhaps less nuanced. Barrel fermented in both new and second year French oak, it adds honeysuckle, sweet apple and a hint of mint to the sweet fruit.",Seven Hills Vineyard Estate,91,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,SÃ©millon,L'Ecole No. 41
4180,US,"Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial. Cassis and black cherry fruit is set against a stiff streak of char and coffee, backed with firm, ripe tannins. The length and balance are just right for ripe fruit from young vines.",,90,30,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mannina Cellars
116551,US,"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least.",Insignia,97,200,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
116564,US,"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.",Backus,95,200,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
74057,US,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crÃ¨me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",Family Reserve,97,625,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming
83298,US,"Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry, cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time. Begin to enjoy this wine in 2016, and it should go far longer than that.",,94,350,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lokoya
135895,US,"A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet.",,84,225,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meteor
